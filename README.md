Site at : https://suryasrikanth.github.io/WebGL-Basic-Audio-Visualizer <br>
Made when learning basics of webgl
Works in all browsers except Chrome.
To make it work in chrome reload the page once it loads.
Error in chrome: (AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) after a user gesture on the page)
As Audio context cannot start without user gesture on the page.
